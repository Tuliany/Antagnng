 <h2>CODE REVIEW</h2>
</div>
 <h3>
    <br> 
    <br>Just as a writer need someone to spell check his or her work, so does software.
    <br>Code review is team work, it is helping each other out to find bugs and error in the coding.
    <br>It is to make sure that the coding is an independent language, able to be "spoken" or 
    <br>understood by anyone. To code review also means building a structure and to organise the coding.
    <br>The benefits of doing so is both to time and money efficient. Therefore code reviewing is something that 
    <br>needs to be done currently all the time, to have a progress of two steps forward and one step back instead of vice versa.
